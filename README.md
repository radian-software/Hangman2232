# Hangman 2 2 3 2

This was a class project for my ninth-grade C++ class. (Not sure why
it was called a C++ class, since mostly we just did iOS development.)
The project is a simple
[hangman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)) game which has
a secret escape hatch into a stock market investment game.
Unfortunately, Apple makes it basically impossible to build old apps
on modern software, so I don't have any screenshots for you :'(

## Why 2232?

It's an in-joke where the only person who gets it is me. You see, my
approach to version control back in the good old days was to just make
a copy of the entire project every once in a while. So I'd start with
`Hangman` and then get `Hangman 2` and `Hangman 3` and so on. But
supposing I made a copy of the second revision, I would get `Hangman 2
2`. Well, you can see where this goes. The final product ended up in a
folder called `Hangman 2 2 3 2`.
