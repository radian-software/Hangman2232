# Hangman game

This was a class project for my ninth-grade C++ class. (Not sure why
it was called a C++ class, since mostly we just did iOS development.)
The project is a simple
[hangman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)) game which has
a secret escape hatch into a stock market investment game.
Unfortunately, Apple makes it basically impossible to build old apps
on modern software, so I don't have any screenshots for you :'(
